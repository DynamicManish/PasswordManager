# PasswordManager
This is a simple Password made in Python(Non GUI), This is basically for beginners to get clarified in Python concepts like Tuples, For loops and some other terminilogies.

The secure codes are the codes that I have given in the form of a tuple, which contain the whole bunch of letters =(not fully alphabetical) and their codes. You do some modifications and make it having more coedes

I am making a few changes in it, in the 'y' and 'n' part, if the user enters anything rather than these letters, it will not affect the case of password
And the new code looks like this
